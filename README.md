🧩 What is GamesGamesGames?

GamesGamesGames is a modular gaming platform designed to host a wide variety of original games — from fast-paced arcade shooters 
to logic-based puzzles, sandbox simulations, and beyond. It serves as both a fun multi-genre collection and a foundation for 
learning game development through hands-on creation. All games live within one shared codebase, allowing for efficient expansion 
and creative experimentation.

🎯 Goals:

1 - Encourage fast prototyping and iteration across game ideas.

2 - Build a community-driven collection of games that span multiple genres.

3 - Create an accessible codebase where new contributors can easily add content.

4 - Focus on simplicity, reusability, and modular design to support ongoing growth.
